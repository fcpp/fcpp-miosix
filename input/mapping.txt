Node mapping
============

Each WandStem nodes has different IDs for different purposes, this table helps
mapping which node is which.

Box number: each node is placed in a box for easy deployment, with a "node0",
"node1" and so on written on it. This ID is used for naming the txt files of the
logs as well, as nodes are connected one by one to a computer and the file name
was made based on the box number.

FCPP ID is a hash of the microcontroller hardware unique ID, used by FCPP to
indentify nodes.

Paper name: we renamed the nodes using a simple incremental number from 0 to 7
to hide the inessential details of the other numbering schemes.

Box     FCPP  Paper
number  id    name
===================
node0  33115  1
node3  33060  0 (kept this as 0 so that min_uid matches)
node5  65449  2
node9  65499  3
node10 65496  4
node11 65448  5
node12 65498  6
node13 65497  7
